  %h1 Community Board
  %p Created as an example for #{link_to "Client / Server Team-up: Pairing Ruby on Rails with iOS", "http://www.tokyorubyistmeetup.org/events/2814"}, an event organized by #{link_to "Tokyo iOS Meetup", "http://www.meetup.com/TokyoiOSMeetup/"} and #{link_to "Tokyo Rubyist Meetup", "http://www.tokyorubyistmeetup.org"}. Participants in the event will add a REST API to this Ruby on Rails application, and then modify an existing iPhone application to consume the API.
  %p The idea of the app itself is a simple message board, where people can post messages in different communities.
